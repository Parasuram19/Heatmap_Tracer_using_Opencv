# Heatmap Tracer using OpenCV

This project uses OpenCV to create a heatmap trace of object movement in a video.  It visualizes the path an object takes over time by creating a heatmap overlay on the video frames.

## Overview

This project processes a video file and detects the movement of a specific object (or any moving object, depending on the configuration).  It then creates a heatmap visualization by accumulating the object's positions over time.  The heatmap shows the areas where the object has spent the most time, with hotter colors indicating higher concentration of movement.

## Features

* **Object Tracking:** Detects and tracks the movement of an object in a video. *(Specify the tracking method used, e.g., background subtraction, color-based tracking, etc.)*
* **Heatmap Generation:** Creates a heatmap overlay on the video frames, showing the object's movement path.
* **Customizable Parameters:**  *(If implemented)* Allows users to customize parameters like heatmap intensity, decay rate, and tracking method.
* **Video Input:** Accepts video files as input.
* **[Other Features]:** List any other relevant features.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **OpenCV (cv2):** For video processing, object tracking, and image manipulation.
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Bash

pip install numpy
[Other Libraries]: List any other Python libraries used.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x: A compatible Python version.
Required Libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries (see above).
Video File: You'll need a video file that you want to analyze.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone [https://github.com/Parasuram19/Heatmap_Tracer_using_Opencv.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dhttps://www.google.com/search%253Fq%253Dhttps://www.google.com/search%25253Fq%25253Dhttps://www.google.com/search%2525253Fq%2525253Dhttps://github.com/Parasuram19/Heatmap_Tracer_using_Opencv.git)
Navigate to the Directory:

Bash

cd Heatmap_Tracer_using_Opencv
Install Dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements.txt file
# OR install individually as shown above
Running the Code
Place Video File: Put your video file in the same directory as the Python script or specify the path to the video file in the script.

Run the Script:

Bash

python heatmap_tracer.py  # Replace heatmap_tracer.py with the name of your script
(Explain any command-line arguments or configuration options.)

Output: The script will process the video and generate a new video file with the heatmap trace.  (Specify the output file name and location.)

Usage
Provide Video: Specify the path to your video file.
Run Script: Execute the Python script.
View Output: The generated video file will show the heatmap trace of the object's movement.
Object Tracking Method
(Explain the object tracking method used in your project.  For example:)

Background Subtraction: Describe which background subtraction method is used (e.g., MOG2, KNNBackgroundSubtractor).
Color-based Tracking: Explain how color is used to track the object.
Other Methods: Describe any other tracking methods used.
Heatmap Implementation
(Explain how the heatmap is generated.  For example:)

Accumulation of Positions: Explain how the object's positions are accumulated to create the heatmap.
Color Mapping: Describe the color scheme used for the heatmap (e.g., from cold to hot colors).
Decay Rate: (If implemented) Explain how the heatmap intensity decays over time.
